```javascript
const query = { name: /John/i }; // Case-insensitive search
db.collection('users').find(query).toArray((err, result) => {
  if (err) throw err;  // Properly handle errors
  console.log(result);
});
```
This code snippet intends to perform a case-insensitive search for the name 'John'. However, it has a subtle bug. If a field is named `name` but does not exist in any documents, `find()` will not return any errors but simply return an empty array which can make it difficult to distinguish between no matches and the field's absence.  Incorrect handling of this scenario may lead to unexpected results in the application logic.

# MongoDB Case-Insensitive Search with Robust Error Handling
This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB queries involving case-insensitive searches and provides a robust solution. The issue arises when searching for a field that may not exist in all documents.  The original code uses a regular expression for case-insensitive matching, but it lacks proper error handling and fails to distinguish between no matching documents and the absence of the field.

The improved solution addresses this by explicitly checking for the field's existence before performing the query. This ensures accurate results and avoids unexpected behavior.
